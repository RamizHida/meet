# Meet
Meet is an serverless, progressive web application (PWA) that displays current events in  
the area of your choice with the help of the Google Calender API. Meet was developed using  
a test-driven development (TDD) approach, via Jest and React Testing Libaray. Meet contains several  
features, from filtering events by city to using the application while offline.


## Use of Serverless Functions: ##
Meet makes use of serverless functions for multiple features. From helping to properly access the Google Calender API,  
via auhtorization, to live data-processing for displaying information of events to a user for a given city.  
Through serverless functions, backend processes become streamlined, therefore limiting source code and improving maintainability,  
all while ensuring users have a good experience while using the app. 

## Technologies Used ##
React, React Testing Libaray, Jest, Puppeteer, AWS Lambda, git, Recharts, Google Calender API.
